1) add validation of the map
V 2) add expandable error header wich will contain all the error_code<->error_message macroses
    so that I could call error() func and just send a error code in it.
X rejected idea 3) swap to the 32x32 images
4) create good images!
V 5) put all libs to libs folder to orginize project.
6) check all the leaks possible
7) add a* algorithm for enemies.
V 8) add redraw(g_d) func so that I could easily redraw a certain tile. check point9 below.
V 9) access map via char **map to make walls unwalkable and player moveable.
    also modify map variable to move objects on a map by moving them in char **map.
10) clear the code. I mean get rid of g_d->smth everywhere! use local variable, they don't bite!
